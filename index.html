                    - 1992 (A Few Good Men) is a 1992 American film directed by Rob Reiner and starring Tom Cruise,
                    Jack Nicholson, Demi Moore, Kiefer Sutherland, Kevin Bacon, and Kevin Pollak in the lead
                    roles. It is based on the play of the same name by Aaron Sorkin. Two military lawyers,
                    Daniel Kaffee (Tom Cruise) and Sam Weinberg (Kevin Pollak), must defend two Marines in
                    court. According to the indictment, they have killed a colleague. However, they maintain
                    that they were following orders from Colonel Nathan R. Jessup (Jack Nicholson) to punish
                    his partner, Private William T. Santiago, for violating the Marine Corps code of honor. It
                    is very difficult for the defense to find out the truth due to the obstacles that the
                    colonel puts on it.
